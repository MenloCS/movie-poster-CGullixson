# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title:** Scream
- **Why I chose this movie:** Classic horror with a suspencful plot and a lot of room to work with

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:**  
Fear
**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:** Knife dripping with blood and with in the blood is the Ghostface mask 
- **Why this element:** So it add suspence and giving a scary vibe in the poster, 

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:** Happy things or joyful colors 

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):** Black & red
- **Accent color(s):**  white
- **Overall mood:** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright) Very dark

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description:**  
 onto a small person in the middle

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**  

A knife closer to the top of the image dripping down with red liquid, and reflecting the blood, and not escaping the bloods outline is a ghostface mask, which is tinted red. Below the liquid which is dripping onto a small silhouttte in a spotlight

- **What worked:** there is a mask, knife and blood
- **What didn't work:**  the blood is dripping onto the mask rather than being a reflection seen within the blood, and there is no person
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  
make the mask be with in the blood
**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  
In a all black background a knife closer to the top of the image has a clearish red liquid dripping down into a puddle, but there is a lot of blood dripping and inside the blood is a reflecting image of a white rubber mask resembling a ghost with an anguished expression., but it is tinted red. In the puddle of blood there is a small silhouette of a person
- **What worked:**  Theres a pool of blood and the knift is in the correct spot
- **What didn't work:** the mask is still to big and is outside the blood line  
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  im going to make the mask inside the pool of blood and have a person falling into it.

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:** 
In a all black background a knife closer to the top of the image has a clearish red liquid dripping down into a puddle, but in the puddle inside the puddle image of a white rubber mask resembling a ghost with an anguished expression., but it is tinted red. THERE IS NOT MASK ON TOP ONLY IN THE PUDDLE OF BLOOD and a small sillhouete of a person is falling into the blood
 
- **What worked:**  There is a mask in the pool of blood
- **What didn't work:**  there is a mask outside as well and there is no person falling
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  Get ride of the mask and just make a person falling

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  
In a all black background a knife closer to the top of the image has a clearish red liquid dripping down into a puddle, and a small silhouette of a person in the middle of the image is falling into the blood

- **What worked:** There is no mask and theres a person  
- **What didn't work:**  the person is just standing in the puddle rather than falling
- **What I'll change for next attempt:** 
make the person fall
**Attempt 5:**  
- **My prompt:** 
In a all black background a knife closer to the top of the image has a clearish red liquid dripping down into a puddle, and a small silhouette of a person in the middle of the image is falling no standing like silhouette of the person who has fallen from some where high and is not yet in the blood but is falling into the puddle of red liquid 

- **What worked:** There a pool of blood and its dripping from a knife, and the person looks afraid 
- **What didn't work:**  the person is still just standing rather than falling

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)  
5 because it the most acturate to what i want and while it might not be falling it still works out fine

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
